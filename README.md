# Vanguard Shaman Tools

`Created by Threewords of the guild "Vanguard", Kronos, Twinstar`

## Usage

* `/vgst` - list of commands
* `/vgst reset` - resets the position and scale of the bar
* `/vgst move` - unlocks the bar so that it can be moved

## Features
* Tracks remaining duration of your totems
* Synchronizes the timers so that everyone sees all totems affecting their party
* Out-of-range indicator for totems that apply aura on the player
* Tick timers for totems that tick, both yours and those from other shamans in your party
* Tracking weapon enchantment from Windfury and Flametongue totems
* Synchronization works on-the-fly, allowing tracking of totem timers that were cast outside of your raid/party as long as the caster is now in it
* If you have BigWigs installed, it will display a warning icon and message when a totem that was affecting you is destroyed (either yours or from another shaman)
